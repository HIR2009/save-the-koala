                <h1>About A Koala</h1>
                <p>Koalas are well-known for their large round head, big furry ears and big black nose. Their fur is
                    usually
                    grey-brown in colour with white fur on the chest, inner arms, ears and bottom.
                    They have an acute sense of smell which also helps them detect other koalas and their favourite
                    food trees. <br>
                    Koalas can only live in one place in the world, Australia. The koala only eats Eucalyptus leaves and
                    it eats so
                    many leaves that it smells like the leaves. The koala hops from tree to tree and climbs the trees to
                    get
                    the leaves.
                    The koala will eat 2.5 pounds of food a day.
